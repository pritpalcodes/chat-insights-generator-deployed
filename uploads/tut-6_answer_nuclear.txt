1)

Dose equivalent (Sv) = Absorbed dose (Gy) × Quality factor

In this case:
- The average absorbed dose to the gastrointestinal tract is 5 mGy (milligray).
- The quality factor for tritium β-particles is given as 1.0.

Now, let's convert the absorbed dose from milligray to gray:
5 mGy = 0.005 Gy

Plugging the values into the dose equivalent formula:
Dose equivalent (Sv) = 0.005 Gy × 1.0
            = 0.005 Sv

To convert sieverts to millisieverts (mSv), multiply by 1000:
0.005 Sv × 1000 = 5 mSv

Therefore, the dose equivalent to the gastrointestinal tract from tritium β-particles is 5 millisieverts (mSv).


2)

I apologize for not addressing the effective dose part of your question in my previous response. Let me provide a more comprehensive answer.

Given:
- The average absorbed dose to the gastrointestinal tract is 5 mGy.
- The radiation weighting factor for beta particles (tritium) is 1.
- We assume a negligible amount of tritium appears in the bladder.

Calculate the equivalent dose in millisieverts (mSv).
Equivalent dose (Sv) = Absorbed dose (Gy) × Radiation weighting factor
Equivalent dose (Sv) = 0.005 Gy × 1 = 0.005 Sv
Equivalent dose (mSv) = 0.005 Sv × 1000 = 5 mSv

According to ICRP 103, the tissue weighting factor for the colon (representing the gastrointestinal tract) is 0.12. The weighting factor for the bladder is 0.04.

Effective dose = Σ (Equivalent dose to organ × Tissue weighting factor for organ)
Effective dose = (5 mSv × 0.12) + (0 mSv × 0.04)
            = 0.6 mSv + 0 mSv
            = 0.6 mSv

Therefore, the equivalent dose to the gastrointestinal tract is 5 millisieverts (mSv), and the effective dose, considering the exposure to the gastrointestinal tract and the negligible exposure to the bladder, is 0.6 millisieverts (mSv).

3)

Given:

The prescribed dose to the tumor is 2 Gy (Gray).
The absorbed dose rate is 50 cGy/min (centigray per minute).
Step 1: Convert the prescribed dose from Gray (Gy) to centigray (cGy).
1 Gy = 100 cGy
2 Gy = 2 × 100 cGy = 200 cGy

Step 2: Calculate the time required to deliver the prescribed dose.
Time = Prescribed dose ÷ Absorbed dose rate
Time = 200 cGy ÷ 50 cGy/min
= 4 min

Therefore, the patient needs to be exposed to the radiotherapy machine for 4 minutes to receive the prescribed dose of 2 Gy.

4)

Given:

The dose delivered to the target area is 10 mGy (milligray).
The absorbed dose in the target area is uniform.
The area of the target is 100 cm².
Step 1: Understand the relationship between the absorbed dose and the energy deposited per unit mass.
The absorbed dose is defined as the energy deposited per unit mass, and the unit Gray (Gy) is equivalent to joules per kilogram (J/kg).
1 Gy = 1 J/kg

Step 2: Convert the dose from milligray (mGy) to gray (Gy).
10 mGy = 0.01 Gy

Step 3: Express the absorbed dose in terms of energy deposited per unit mass.
Absorbed dose = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg

Therefore, the energy deposited per unit mass (absorbed dose) in the target area is 0.01 J/kg (joules per kilogram).

Note: The area of the target (100 cm²) is not used in this calculation because the absorbed dose is already given, and it is a measure of energy deposited per unit mass, not per unit area.

5)

Convert the accumulated dose from millisieverts (mSv) to microsieverts (μSv).
1 mSv = 1000 μSv
50 mSv = 50 × 1000 μSv = 50,000 μSv

Determine the number of hours in a year.
1 year = 365 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
1 day = 24 hours
Number of hours in a year = 365 × 24 = 8,760 hours

Step 3: Calculate the average dose rate in μSv/h.
Average dose rate = Accumulated dose ÷ Number of hours in a year
Average dose rate = 50,000 μSv ÷ 8,760 hours
                  ≈ 5.71 μSv/h

Therefore, the average dose rate received by the radiation worker throughout the year is approximately 5.71 μSv/h (microsieverts per hour).

6)

Given:

The dose delivered to the tumor is 2 Gy (Gray).
The tumor is located 5 cm deep in the patient's body.
The linear energy transfer (LET) of the radiation beam is 20 keV/μm.
As stated before, the energy deposited per unit length is equal to the LET of the radiation beam, and we don't need to use the given dose of 2 Gy.

Step 1: Convert the LET from keV/μm to eV/m.
1 keV = 1000 eV
1 μm = 10⁻⁶ m

LET = 20 keV/μm
= 20 × 1000 eV / (1 × 10⁻⁶ m)
= 2 × 10¹⁰ eV/m

Therefore, the energy deposited per unit length in the tumor tissue is 2 × 10¹⁰ eV/m (electronvolts per meter).

7)

Absorbed dose measures the energy absorbed by the material, while kerma measures the energy transferred to charged particles.

Absorbed dose includes the energy deposited by both directly and indirectly ionizing radiation, while kerma only considers the energy transferred from indirectly ionizing radiation to directly ionizing particles.

Absorbed dose is measured at the location where the energy is absorbed, while kerma is measured at the location where the energy is transferred to charged particles, which may be different from where the energy is ultimately absorbed.

8)

The radiation weighting factor (wR) accounts for the biological effectiveness of different types of radiation, while the tissue weighting factor (wT) accounts for the sensitivity of various organs and tissues to radiation.

Radiation weighting factor (wR):
Depends on the type and energy of radiation
Used to convert absorbed dose (Gy) to equivalent dose (Sv)
Tissue weighting factor (wT):
Represents the relative contribution of each organ or tissue to the overall radiation detriment
Used to calculate the effective dose (Sv) by summing the weighted equivalent doses to all organs and tissues

9)

According to the information provided in the lecture slides (Lecture 24 Radiotherapy.pdf), the biologic basis for radiation therapy is as follows:

Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA of cells and destroying their ability to reproduce.

Both normal and cancer cells can be affected by radiation, but cancer cells have a generally impaired ability to repair this damage, leading to cell death.

All tissues have a tolerance level, or maximum dose, beyond which irreparable damage may occur.

According to the lecture slides (Lecture 24 Radiotherapy.pdf), radiation therapy serves two major functions in the clinical treatment of cancer:

To cure cancer:
Destroy tumors that have not spread
Kill residual microscopic disease left after surgery or chemotherapy

To reduce or palliate symptoms:
Shrink tumors affecting quality of life, e.g., a lung tumor causing shortness of breath
Alleviate pain or neurologic symptoms by reducing the size of a tumor

11)

According to the lecture slides (Lecture 24 Radiotherapy.pdf), five common radiation side effects that vary depending on the site of treatment are:

Breast – swelling, skin redness
Abdomen – nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
Chest – cough, shortness of breath, esophageal irritation
Head and neck – taste alterations, dry mouth, skin redness
Pelvis – diarrhea, cramping, urinary frequency, vaginal irritation

12)

According to the lecture slides (Lecture 24 Radiotherapy.pdf), palliative radiation therapy is a type of radiation therapy that is commonly used to relieve pain and other symptoms caused by cancer, rather than to cure the disease itself.

Key points about palliative radiation therapy:

It is commonly used to relieve pain from bone cancers (metastases).
Approximately 50 percent of patients receive total relief from their pain.
80 to 90 percent of patients will derive some relief.


Other palliative uses include:
Spinal cord compression
Vascular compression, e.g., superior vena cava syndrome
Bronchial obstruction
Bleeding from gastrointestinal or gynecologic tumors
Esophageal obstruction
In summary, palliative radiation therapy is an effective treatment for relieving pain and other symptoms caused by cancer, especially in cases of bone metastases

Radiation Oncologist: This is the main doctor who is in charge of the patient's radiation therapy. They decide what type of radiation therapy the patient needs and how much radiation should be given.

Medical Physicist: This person makes sure that the radiation therapy machines are working properly and that the treatment plan is designed specifically for each patient.

Dosimetrist: This team member works closely with the radiation oncologist and medical physicist to figure out the right amount of radiation needed for the patient's treatment.

Radiation Therapist: This person is responsible for giving the patient their daily radiation treatments, following the plan made by the radiation oncologist.

15)
Brachytherapy:

Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy where radioactive sources are implanted directly into the tumor or surrounding tissue.
The radioactive sources used in brachytherapy include 125I, 103Pd, 192Ir, and 137Cs.
The purpose of brachytherapy is to deliver high doses of radiation to the desired target while minimizing the dose to surrounding normal tissues.
Difference between permanent and temporary implants:

Permanent implants:
Permanent implants release small amounts of radiation over a period of several months.
Examples include low-dose-rate prostate implants ("seeds").
Patients receiving permanent implants may be minimally radioactive and should avoid close contact with children or pregnant women.


Temporary implants:
Temporary implants are left in the body for several hours to several days.
The patient may require hospitalization during the implant depending on the treatment site.
Examples include low-dose-rate gynecologic (GYN) implants and high-dose-rate prostate or breast implants.

16)
IORT is a type of radiation therapy given during surgery, directly to the area where the tumor was removed. This technique has several advantages:

It reduces the amount of healthy tissue exposed to radiation by focusing the treatment on a smaller, more precise area.
It allows doctors to protect or shield normal, healthy tissues that might otherwise be exposed to radiation.
It enables the delivery of a higher effective dose of radiation to the tumor site.
Recent studies have shown that IORT is effective in treating breast cancer.
